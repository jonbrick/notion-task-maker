# AI Summary Context

## Writing Style Rules

### Avoid Corporate HR Speak

- NEVER use: "participated in", "collaborated", "attended social events"
- Use natural verbs: "went to", "worked with", "hung out"

## Definitions

### People

- **Person Name**: Relationship or context

### Bars/Restaurants

- **Place Name**: Type of establishment

### General

- **Abbreviation**: Full meaning
```

### Output Examples

**Before customization:**

> "Participated in social events with colleagues and attended multiple restaurants for dining experiences."

**After customization:**

> "Went to Pubkey with Alex and Pat, had dinner at Gene's with Jen."

## 🔧 Configuration

### Week Naming

The script automatically handles both formats:

- Single digit: "Week 1 Recap" → "Week 01 Recap"
- Double digit: "Week 11 Recap" (no change needed)

### AI Settings

- **Model**: Claude 3 Haiku (cost-effective)
- **Max tokens**: 80 (keeps summaries concise)
- **Cost**: ~$0.003 per week summary

## 📊 Sample Output

```bash
🚀 Starting summary generation for weeks: 1, 2, 3, 4
📊 Processing 4 week(s)...

🗓️  === PROCESSING WEEK 1 ===
✅ Found Week 01 Recap!
📅 Week 01 date range: 2024-12-29 to 2025-01-04

🤖 Generated summary: Went to Pubkey with Alex and Pat, had dinner at Gene's with Jen, attended all 3 Phish concerts.

✅ Successfully updated Week 01 recap!

```

## 🛡️ Security

- **API keys**: Protected in `.env` (not committed to git)
- **Personal context**: `context.md` excluded from git
- **Database IDs**: Stored securely in environment variables

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Could not find Week X Recap"

- Check that your recap page is named exactly "Week XX Recap"
- Verify the page exists in your Recap database

### "Week X has no week relation"

- Ensure your recap page is linked to the correct week in the "⌛ Weeks" field

### "No tasks found"

- Verify tasks have Status = "🟢 Done"
- Check that Due Date falls within the week's date range
- Confirm task Type matches the expected categories

### Context not loading

- Ensure `context.md` exists in the same folder as `summary.js`
- Check file permissions and encoding (should be UTF-8)

## 💰 Cost Estimation

- **Per week**: ~$0.003 (0.3 cents)
- **Per year (52 weeks)**: ~$0.16
- **Batch processing 10 weeks**: ~$0.03

Very cost-effective for the time saved!
